Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.
   Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity, versatility, and readability. Here are some key features and popular use cases that contribute to its widespread popularity among developers:

Scientific Computing- Python is extensively used in scientific research and simulations due to its simplicity, readability, and powerful libraries like SciPy and Matplotlib.
Example- Conducting numerical simulations, plotting data, and analyzing scientific datasets in fields like physics, biology, and astronomy.


2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
   Download Python installer from the official website and run it, ensuring to add Python to PATH (Windows).
   Open Terminal/Command Prompt and verify Python and pip installation using 'python --version'.
   Use virtualenv to create isolated environments for projects, create a virtual environment named venv Windows: 'python -m venv venv' In Windows activate using : 'venv\Scripts\activate'


3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
     # Simple Python program to print "Hello, World!"
     print("Hello, World!")

     The line # Simple Python program to print "Hello, World!" is a comment. Comments in Python start with the # symbol and are ignored by the interpreter. They are used to explain code or provide context.
     The print() function in Python is used to output data to the console (or standard output),print("Hello, World!") - This statement outputs the string "Hello, World!" to the console.
     Strings - '"Hello, World!" is a string literal in Python. Strings are sequences of characters enclosed within single (') or double (") quotes.
     Function Call - In Python, functions are called using parentheses after the function name. Here, print() is a built-in function that takes a string as an argument.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
   Integer (int) represents whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimal points.
   Example x = 5
   Float (float) represents numbers with decimal points or numbers in scientific notation.
   Example: y = 3.14
   String (str) represents sequences of characters enclosed within single (') or double (") quotes.
   Example: name = "Ian"
   Boolean (bool) represents truth values True or False.
   Example: is_active = True
   List (list) represents ordered collections of items, which can be of different data types.
   Example: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   Tuple (tuple) similar to lists but immutable (cannot be changed after creation).
   Example: coordinates = (15, 40)
   Dictionary (dict) represents key-value pairs enclosed within curly braces {}.
   Example: person = {'name': 'Ian', 'age': 25}
   # Integer
age = 25

# Float
height = 1.81

# String
name = "Ian"

# Boolean
is_student = True

# List
grades = [85, 92, 78, 90]

# Tuple
coordinates = (15, 40)

# Dictionary
person = {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 28, 'city': 'New York'}

# Printing variables
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height)
print("Is student?", is_student)
print("Grades:", grades)
print("Coordinates:", coordinates)
print("Person:", person)


5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
   In Python, conditional statements and loops are fundamental control structures that allow you to control the flow of execution in your programs based on certain conditions or to repeat a block of code multiple times.
   Conditional statements in Python are used to make decisions based on conditions. The if-else statement is the most common form, example;
   # Example: Checking if a number is positive or negative
num = 30

if num >= 0:
    print("The number is positive or zero.")
else:
    print("The number is negative.")

    Loops in Python are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as lists, tuples, or strings),example;
    # Example of iteration over a list of names
names = ["Ian", "Bob", "Charlie", "Brian"]

for name in names:
    print("Hello,", name)

    

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
   Functions in Python are blocks of code that are designed to perform a specific task or calculation. They are reusable and can be called multiple times within a program. Functions help organize code, improve readability, and facilitate code reuse.
def calculate_sum(num1, num2):
     """Function to calculate the sum of two numbers."""
    return num1 + num2
# Calling the function with arguments
result = calculate_sum(5, 3)
print("Sum:", result)  # Output: Sum: 8

# Calling the function with different arguments
result = calculate_sum(-10, 20)
print("Sum:", result)  # Output: Sum: 10


7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

   Lists in Python are ordered collections of items. Each item in a list is indexed by its position, starting from 0 while Dictionaries in Python are unordered collections of items where each item is stored as a key-value pair. 
   Elements in a list can be of any data type (e.g., integers, strings, other lists, etc.) while keys in a dictionary must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples).
   Elements in a list are accessed by their index while elements in a dictionary are accessed by their keys, not by their position.
Example of a list:
# Creating a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Example of dictionaries:
# Creating a dictionary of key-value pairs
person = {
    'name': 'Tan',
    'age': 30,
    'city': 'New York'
}

Script Demonstrating Basic Operations on Lists and Dictionaries;
# Creating a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Creating a dictionary of key-value pairs
person = {
    'name': 'Kay',
    'age': 30,
    'city': 'Nairobi'
}

# Accessing elements
print("First number in the list:", numbers[0])     # Output: First number in the list: 1
print("Person's name:", person['name'])            # Output: Person's name: Kay

# Modifying elements
numbers[2] = 10
person['age'] = 31

print("Updated list:", numbers)                    # Output: Updated list: [1, 2, 10, 4, 5]
print("Updated age:", person['age'])               # Output: Updated age: 31

# Adding elements
numbers.append(6)
person['job'] = 'Engineer'

print("Extended list:", numbers)                   # Output: Extended list: [1, 2, 10, 4, 5, 6]
print("Updated person:", person)                   # Output: Updated person: {'name': 'Kay', 'age': 31, 'city': 'Nairobi', 'job': 'Engineer'}

# Removing elements
del numbers[0]
person.pop('city')

print("Trimmed list:", numbers)                    # Output: Trimmed list: [2, 10, 4, 5, 6]
print("Trimmed person:", person)                   # Output: Trimmed person: {'name': 'Kay', 'age': 31, 'job': 'Engineer'}


8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
   Exception handling in Python allows you to handle runtime errors (exceptions) gracefully, preventing your program from crashing when unexpected situations occur. Key components of exception handling include try, except, and optionally finally blocks:
   'try block' - This block is used to enclose the code that might raise an exception.
   'except block' - This block is executed if an exception occurs within the try block. You can specify the type of exception to catch or use a generic except block to catch all exceptions.
   'finally block' - This block, if included, is executed regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It's typically used for cleanup tasks.

   EXAMPLE;
   # Example: Handling division by zero exception

def divide_numbers(x, y):
    try:
        result = x / y
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
    else:
        print(f"{x} divided by {y} is {result:.2f}")
    finally:
        print("Execution completed.")

# Test cases
divide_numbers(10, 2)     # Output: 10 divided by 2 is 5.00 \n Execution completed
divide_numbers(8, 0)      # Output: Error: Division by zero is not allowed. \n Execution completed


9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
   Modules- A module in Python is a file containing Python code, including functions, classes, and variables, which can be reused in other Python programs.
   Modules help organize and structure code, making it easier to manage and maintain.
   Modules can be imported into other modules or scripts to use the functions and variables defined in them.
   Packages- A package is a collection of modules organized in directories that include a special '__init__.py' file. This file indicates that the directory should be treated as a package.
   Packages allow for a hierarchical structuring of the module namespace using dot notation, facilitating the organization and reuse of code across different projects.
   You can import a module using the import statement. To use specific functions or variables from a module, you can use the dot notation. 'import math'
   EXAMPLE;

   import math

# Calculate the square root of a number
number = 16
sqrt_result = math.sqrt(number)
print(f"The square root of {number} is {sqrt_result}")

# Calculate the sine of an angle (in radians)
angle = math.pi / 4  # 45 degrees in radians
sine_result = math.sin(angle)
print(f"The sine of {angle} radians is {sine_result}")

# Using constants from the math module
print(f"The value of pi is {math.pi}")
print(f"The value of Euler's number (e) is {math.e}")


10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

   To read from a file, you can use the open() function in combination with the read() or readlines() methods. The with statement is often used to ensure the file is properly closed after its suite finishes.
   Example;
   # Script to read the content of a file and print it to the console

# Specify the file name
file_name = 'example.txt'

# Read the file and print its content
with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

   To write to a file, you can use the open() function with the write() or writelines() methods. Using the with statement ensures the file is properly closed after writing.
   Example;
   # Script to write a list of strings to a file

# List of strings to write to the file
lines = [
    "Hello, World!\n",
    "Welcome to Python file handling.\n",
    "This is the third line.\n"
]

# Specify the file name
file_name = 'output.txt'

# Write the list of strings to the file
with open(file_name, 'w') as file:
    file.writelines(lines)

print(f"Content written to {file_name}")
 
 Below is the combined code

 # Writing a list of strings to a file
lines_to_write = [
    "First line\n",
    "Second line\n",
    "Third line\n"
]
output_file = 'example_output.txt'

with open(output_file, 'w') as file:
    file.writelines(lines_to_write)

print(f"Content written to {output_file}")

# Reading the content of the file and printing it to the console
with open(output_file, 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print("\nContent of the file:")
    print(content)

   In this write a list of strings to example_output.txt.
   Then read the content of example_output.txt and print it to the console.
